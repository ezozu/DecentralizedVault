# DecentralizedVault: Secure and Immutable Data Storage on the Blockchain

DecentralizedVault is a Python-based project that provides a secure, immutable, and decentralized data storage solution leveraging blockchain technology. It offers a robust platform for storing sensitive information, guaranteeing data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications through the inherent security features of a distributed ledger. The project allows users to manage and retrieve data securely without relying on centralized authorities, enhancing trust and transparency in data management.

This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional data storage systems and the benefits of blockchain. By utilizing cryptographic principles and distributed consensus mechanisms, DecentralizedVault ensures that data is not only stored securely but also verifiable by any participant in the network. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for integration with various blockchain platforms and data types. It prioritizes security, efficiency, and scalability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from document storage to sensitive financial records.

DecentralizedVault offers a user-friendly interface and a well-defined API for developers to easily integrate blockchain-based data storage into their applications. The project emphasizes data privacy by employing encryption techniques to protect sensitive information while stored on the blockchain. The systems design promotes fault tolerance by distributing data across multiple nodes, ensuring continuous availability even in the event of node failures. This provides a reliable and resilient solution for organizations seeking to protect their data and enhance their data governance practices.

## Key Features

*   **Blockchain-Based Data Storage:** Utilizes a distributed ledger for storing data, ensuring immutability and preventing unauthorized modifications. Implements a smart contract interaction layer to manage data storage and retrieval operations.
*   **Data Encryption:** Employs AES-256 encryption to protect sensitive data before storing it on the blockchain. The encryption keys are managed securely using a hierarchical key management system for enhanced security.
*   **Decentralized Access Control:** Implements a role-based access control system, allowing granular control over who can access and modify specific data. Access rights are stored on the blockchain and enforced by smart contracts.
*   **IPFS Integration:** Stores large data files on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and stores only the IPFS hash on the blockchain, optimizing storage efficiency and reducing blockchain transaction costs. The IPFS integration includes pinning services to ensure data availability.
*   **Smart Contract Automation:** Utilizes smart contracts to automate data storage, retrieval, and access control processes. The smart contracts are written in Solidity and thoroughly tested for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Versioning:** Maintains a complete history of all data modifications, allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed. Each version is associated with a timestamp and a unique identifier for easy tracking.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for the application logic, API endpoints, and data processing tasks. Python was chosen for its versatility, extensive libraries, and ease of use.
*   **Solidity:** Used for writing smart contracts that manage data storage and retrieval on the blockchain. Solidity's syntax is similar to Javascript which makes it easy to learn and use.
*   **Web3.py:** A Python library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and deploying/managing smart contracts. Facilitates communication between the Python application and the blockchain network.
*   **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** A decentralized storage network used for storing large data files. IPFS provides content-addressing, making it easy to retrieve data based on its hash.
*   **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for creating API endpoints for data storage and retrieval. Flask provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications in Python.
*   **Ethereum (or other compatible blockchain):** The underlying blockchain platform used for storing data hashes and managing access control. Ethereum was selected for its wide adoption and mature ecosystem.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/DecentralizedVault.git
    cd DecentralizedVault

2.  Install Python 3.8 or higher.

3.  Create a virtual environment:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

4.  Install the required Python packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

5.  Install Ganache or any other local blockchain development environment.

6.  Install IPFS: Follow the instructions on the official IPFS website (https://ipfs.io/). Ensure IPFS is running in the background.

## Configuration

1.  Set up the environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:
    BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=http://127.0.0.1:7545
    CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress
    ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=YourPrivateKey
    IPFS_GATEWAY=http://127.0.0.1:5001
    ENCRYPTION_KEY=YourSecretEncryptionKey

    Replace `http://127.0.0.1:7545` with your local blockchain network's RPC URL, `0xYourContractAddress` with the address of your deployed smart contract, `YourPrivateKey` with the private key of the account you will use to interact with the smart contract, `http://127.0.0.1:5001` with your IPFS gateway URL, and `YourSecretEncryptionKey` with a secure encryption key.

2.  Deploy the smart contract to your local blockchain network. You can use Remix IDE or Truffle for deployment.

3.  Update the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable with the deployed smart contract address.

## Usage

Example of how to use the API endpoints after deployment:

Store Data:

import requests
import json

url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/store_data"
headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}
data = {'data': 'This is the data I want to store securely.'}
response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(data), headers=headers)
print(response.text)

Retrieve Data:

import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/retrieve_data?data_id=0"
response = requests.get(url)
print(response.text)

The API documentation should detail all available endpoints including store_data, retrieve_data, and access_control. It should provide code samples for each, explaining input parameters and expected responses. Authentication schemes should be outlined as well. This README will be updated with complete API documentation at a later point.
